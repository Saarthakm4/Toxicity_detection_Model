# Toxicity Detection Model
Welcome to the Toxicity Detection Model repository! This notebook contains code for training and evaluating a toxicity detection model using natural language processing techniques.

##Overview
Toxicity in online discussions and social media platforms is a significant issue. This notebook aims to provide a solution by demonstrating how to build and evaluate a toxicity detection model using machine learning.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: The notebook demonstrates how to preprocess text data for toxicity detection.
Model Training: Shows how to train a toxicity detection model using a machine learning algorithm.
Model Evaluation: Provides methods for evaluating the performance of the trained model.

## Usage
