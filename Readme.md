Toxicity Detection Model
Welcome to the Toxicity Detection Model repository! This project aims to identify toxic comments in online discussions using machine learning techniques. Toxic comments can have a detrimental effect on online communities, and our goal is to provide a tool to help identify and mitigate such toxicity.

Overview
Toxicity in online discussions and social media platforms is a significant issue, affecting user experience, community engagement, and even mental health. Our toxicity detection model utilizes state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques to classify comments as toxic or non-toxic, enabling platforms to filter and moderate harmful content more effectively.

Features
Pre-trained Model: Our model is trained on a diverse dataset of toxic and non-toxic comments from various online platforms.
Customizable: Users can fine-tune the model on their own datasets or adjust hyperparameters to suit their specific needs.
Easy to Use: The model provides a simple API for loading and making predictions on new comments, making it accessible to developers and researchers.
